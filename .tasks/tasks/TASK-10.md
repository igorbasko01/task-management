title: change update- commands to only update with options

## Description
Today the implementation is such that if I want to update a task's priority or category
I need to use one of the commands: `task update-category ` or `task update-priority `.
I think it would be better to have a single update command with options: 
`task update --category "Bug" --priority "High"`
