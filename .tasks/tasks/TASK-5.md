## Description
Today if I would like to move a task to the `In Progress` board,
I need to write the board name in two words and with qoutes: `task move 2 "In Progress"`.
I would like to have some shortcut for the board names: `Backlog -> bl, In Progress -> ip, Done -> dn`.

Shoul support:
1. `task list-tasks 5 --board ip`
1. `task move 5 dn`
